Rich of daily furniture and objects.&quot;<br>- Contains the necessary furniture and setup for the specified function.<br>- Each objects is in **reasonable size**, neatly placed, objects of the same category are well aglined, relationships are reasonable (e.g., chairs face desks), sufficient space exists for walking, and **orientations must** be correct.<br>- [IMPORTANT] All necessary large and small items are present. Has rich details. <br>[IMPORTANT] Each shelf is full of objects (&gt;5) inside. <br>[IMPORTANT] Each supporter (e.g. table, desk, and shelf) has small objects on it. <br>[IMPORTANT] The room feels done.<br>[IMPORTANT] You can&#x27;t stop the scene generation before all necessary object placements have been done.</p><p>You must avoid:<br>- Unusual objects or strange placements make the room unrealistic.<br>- Missing key objects or contains mismatched furniture (e.g., no bed in a bedroom).<br>- Floating objects, crowded floor, **abnormal size**, objects with collision, incorrect **orientation**, or large items placed oddly (e.g., sofa not against the wall). Large empty space. Blocker in front of furniture.<br>- Room is sparse or empty, lacks decor or key elements.</p><p>(ix) Don&#x27;t try to replace all objects in room, <br>it would remove all objects you have placed in.</p><p>(x) Pay attention to the place_id of objects.</p><p>(xi) How to decide what objects to place?<br>- [IMPORTANT] From the user requirements here. You need to ensure all the requirements for object placements here are all satisfied.<br>- [IMPORTANT] From the failured placements each iterations. You need to retry once if the failure happens when placing objects.<br>You can try to place other smaller types of objects if placements failed due to limited space.<br>- [IMPORTANT] From the semantic critic info. You need to combine all the proposed actions in semantic info to place those urgent needed objects.<br>Special notes: never add rugs, mats, curtains, blanket, ceiling-hanging objects (already installed).</p><p>(xii) When to stop generating the scene?<br>[IMPORTANT] You need to keep track of the current object placement situation to decide.<br>[IMPORTANT] You can&#x27;t stop the scene generation before all necessary object placements have been done:<br>[IMPORTANT] 1. All necessary large and small items are present. Has rich details. <br>[IMPORTANT] 2. Each shelf is full of objects (&gt;5) inside. <br>[IMPORTANT] 3. Each supporter (e.g. table, desk, and shelf) has small objects on it. <br>If placements of small on top objects are failed, keep trying different kinds of objects.<br>[IMPORTANT] When you want to stop, please check every condition above and ensure all have been satisfied before you stop.<br>[IMPORTANT] You are encouraged to keep trying placing objects if they are reasonable.<br>[IMPORTANT] Don&#x27;t be afraid of failure of placements. Please keep trying instead of suddenly stopping.</p><p>Notes:</p><p>When placing objects, you need to specify where each object should be located. <br>The location can be one of three types:</p><p>(i) &quot;floor&quot; - for objects that sit on the ground/floor. This includes objects placed against walls, in corners, beside/next to other floor objects, or anywhere on the floor surface.</p><p>Examples: <br>- A table against the wall → use &quot;floor&quot; (the table sits on floor near the wall)<br>- A sofa in the corner → use &quot;floor&quot; (the sofa sits on floor in the corner)<br>- A chair next to / beside / left of / right of / in front of the table → use &quot;floor&quot; (the chair sits on floor near the table)</p><p>(ii) &quot;wall&quot; - ONLY for objects that are physically attached or mounted directly on the wall surface, and always attached above the floor, such as wall shelves, paintings, or wall-mounted TVs.</p><p>Examples:<br>- A picture on the wall → use &quot;wall&quot; (the picture is mounted on the wall and above the floor)<br>- A wall-mounted cabinet above the bed → use &quot;wall&quot; (the cabinet is attached to the wall and above the floor)</p><p>(iii) &quot;object_id&quot; or &quot;estimated_object_name&quot; - ONLY for objects that are placed onto/on top of another existing object. </p><p>Use &quot;object_id&quot; when you know the exact id of the existing object. Use &quot;estimated_object_name&quot; when you&#x27;re not certain of the exact object id or the object is about to be placed.</p><p>Examples:<br>- A lamp on a table → use the table&#x27;s object_id (the lamp goes on top of the table)<br>- A plate on the kitchen cabinet in front of the chair → use the cabinet&#x27;s object_id (the plate goes on top of the cabinet)</p><p>[IMPORTANT] The key distinction: if the spatial relationship is NOT &quot;on top of&quot; (e.g., beside, next to, in front of), you cannot use object_id or estimated_object_name. In such cases, use &quot;floor&quot; instead.</p><p>[IMPORTANT] Don&#x27;t use &quot;floor&quot; or &quot;wall&quot; as fallback when the correct location should be an object_id. Be precise about the placement location.</p><p>[IMPORTANT] Be accurate and clear about the placement location, <br>when refer to existing objects, mention exact object id if applicable. <br>Specified as &quot;place [object_quantity] [object_type] [object description] on [object_place_location (floor|wall|existing / other objects)], [extra placement guidance]&quot;</p><p>[IMPORTANT] In the return of every tool use, the placement description `place on [place_location]` of objects follow the same pattern above.</p></div></div></div>

                                <div class="thinking-content">We need to generate the room layout first: medium-sized bedroom, single room. Use generate_room_layout. Then place objects in stages using place_objects_in_room with placement_conditions describing objects, their relationships, styles, etc.

We need to ensure we follow guidelines: place key furniture: bed, nightstands, dresser, wardrobe, desk maybe, chair, bookshelf, lamp(s), rug? Actually note says never add rugs, mats, curtains, blanket, ceiling-hanging objects (already installed). So no rug. Include decorations like paintings on wall, shelves with books, desk with lamp, etc.

We need each shelf full of &gt;5 items inside. We need each supporter have small objects on it (e.g., nightstand with lamp, books, alarm clock; desk with laptop, pen holder, books; dresser top with jewelry box, box, etc; bookshelf with books). Ensure style consistent (e.g., modern minimalist).

First call: generate_room_layout with description specifying single medium-sized bedroom, modern minimalist style, include recommendations.

Let&#x27;s craft input: &quot;Create a single medium-sized bedroom with a modern minimalist style. Include walls, a door, and two windows. Provide layout recommendations for placing bed, nightstands, wardrobe, dresser, desk, chair, bookshelf, wall-mounted shelves, and wall art.&quot;

Furniture surfaces should be decorated with 22 functional and decorative objects: Queen size bed placed on floor|none|bed; 2 Wooden nightstands placed on floor|none|nightstand; Sliding wardrobe placed on floor|none|wardrobe; Low dresser placed on floor|none|dresser; Minimalist desk placed on floor|none|desk; Ergonomic chair placed on floor|none|chair; Tall bookshelf placed on floor|none|bookshelf; 2 Wall\u2011mounted shelfs placed on wall|none|shelf; 2 Abstract paintings placed on wall|none|painting; 2 Bedside lamps placed on floor|nightstand|lamp; Floor lamp placed on floor|none|lamp; 2 Indoor plants placed on floor|none|plant; 2 Ceramic vases placed on floor|dresser|vase; Digital alarm clock placed on floor|nightstand|clock; Wall mirror placed on wall|none|mirror; Small trash can placed on floor|none|trashcan; Wall coat rack placed on wall|none|coatrack; 8 Hardcover books placed on floor|bookshelf|book; 4 Photo frames placed on floor|dresser|frame; 2 Phone chargers placed on floor|desk|charger; Bluetooth speaker placed on floor|desk|speaker; Wireless headphones placed on floor|desk|headphones. Each furniture surface such as tables, desks, shelves, and cabinets should have at least 2 or more decorative or functional objects placed on top to create a lived-in, realistic environment. Important constraints: Do not add rugs, mats, carpets, curtains, blankets, ceiling-hanging objects, or ceiling objects to the scene as these are either already installed or restricted. The complete scene must contain a minimum of 22 objects total following the placement proposals described above to achieve a complete, diverse, and realistic room environment.Must ensure that: i. The layout (position, rotation, and size) is believable, and common daily objects make the room feel lived-in. Rich of daily furniture and objects.ii. Contains the necessary furniture and setup for the specified function.iii. Each objects is in **reasonable size**, neatly placed, objects of the same category are well aglined, relationships are reasonable (e.g., chairs face desks), sufficient space exists for walking, and **orientations must** be correct. iv. All necessary large and small items are present. Has rich details. Each shelf is full of objects (&gt;5) inside. Each supporter (e.g. table, desk, and shelf) has small objects on it. The room feels done.Must avoid that: i. Unusual objects or strange placements make the room unrealistic.ii. Missing key objects or contains mismatched furniture (e.g., no bed in a bedroom).iii. Floating objects, crowded floor, **abnormal size**, objects with collision, incorrect **orientation**, or large items placed oddly (e.g., sofa not against the wall). Large empty space. Blocker in front of furniture.iv. Room is sparse or empty, lacks decor or key elements.&quot;<br>}</p></div>

                                <div class="thinking-content">We have layout and recommendations. Now we need to place objects. Must stage: first key large furniture: bed, nightstands, wardrobe, dresser, desk, chair, bookshelf, wall shelves, paintings on walls.

We need to include style: modern minimalist.

So first placement: Place queen bed, two nightstands (one each side), wardrobe, dresser, desk with chair, bookshelf, two wall-mounted shelves, two paintings.

We need to describe placement using &quot;place [quantity] [object_type] ...&quot; with location.

We must use &quot;floor&quot; for floor furniture, &quot;wall&quot; for wall-mounted items, and for nightstand lamps later.

For each object, we also need to assign an object_id? Not necessary now; just describe placement.

We must not exceed 12 types per call. This call includes many types but maybe okay. Types: bed, nightstand, wardrobe, dresser, desk, chair, bookshelf, shelf (wall-mounted), painting. That&#x27;s 9 types, okay.

We&#x27;ll construct placement_conditions: &quot;place 1 queen-size bed on floor, centered against the longer wall opposite the door; place 2 wooden nightstands on floor, one on each side of the bed; place 1 sliding wardrobe on floor, against the left wall near the door; place 1 low dresser on floor, against the right wall; place 1 minimalist desk on floor, against the wall opposite the wardrobe; place 1 ergonomic chair on floor, positioned at the desk facing it; place 1 tall bookshelf on floor, positioned in the corner between the dresser and the wall opposite the door; place 2 wall-mounted shelves on wall, one above the desk and one above the bed on the opposite wall; place 2 abstract paintings on wall, one above the bed and one on the wall opposite the door.&quot;

Need to specify style: modern minimalist.

                                <div class="thinking-content">The semantic critic recommends many actions, but note we have restrictions: &quot;never add rugs, mats, curtains, blanket, ceiling-hanging objects (already installed).&quot; Yet the critic suggests adding rug and blanket; we must ignore those. We must follow our own guidance, not the critic fully. Remove rug and blanket.

We need to add many items: books on bookshelf, vase, figurines; books/plants/lamp on wall shelves; laptop, pens, notebook, mug on desk; mirror, toiletries, book on dresser; lamps and books and phone on nightstands; pillows on bed (allowed), blanket is disallowed (blanket prohibited). So skip blanket. Add floor lamp and plant allowed. Also add small indoor plant (allowed). Add maybe trash can but not required.

We need to ensure each shelf is full of &gt;5 objects. Bookshelf currently empty, need at least 8 books etc. Also each supporter needs at least 2+ small objects.

We need to place these items in calls, respecting limit of 10-12 types per call and 35-40 objects per call. We&#x27;ll likely do one call with many items but have many types: book, vase, figurine, plant, lamp, laptop, pen, notebook, mug, mirror, toiletries, pillow, floor lamp, plant (again), maybe phone. That&#x27;s many types maybe &gt;12. We must split.

We can split into two calls: First fill bookshelf and bookshelf accessories (books, vase, figurine). That&#x27;s types: book, vase, figurine. That&#x27;s 3 types, okay.

Second fill wall shelves (books, plant, lamp). Types: book, plant, lamp. 3 types.

Third fill desk (laptop, pen, notebook, mug). Types: laptop, pen, notebook, mug (4 types).

Fourth fill dresser (mirror, toiletries, book). Types: mirror, toiletries, book (3 types).

Fifth fill nightstands (lamp, book, phone). Types: lamp, book, phone (3 types). Also add pillows on bed (pillow). That&#x27;s another type maybe pillow.

Sixth add floor lamp and floor plant (floor lamp, plant). Types: floor_lamp, plant (2 types). But may combine with nightstand call.

We need to ensure IDs for placement: we have object IDs from earlier. Use those.

Let&#x27;s list IDs:

- bookshelf: room_270fe061_bookshelf_0b575bfe
- shelf_1: room_270fe061_shelf_1d7488fd
- shelf_2: room_270fe061_shelf_293d2c09
- desk: room_270fe061_desk_0b0d67c9
- dresser: room_270fe061_dresser_b02f7132
- nightstand left: room_270fe061_nightstand_56d58526
- nightstand right: room_270fe061_nightstand_81a265c3
- bed: room_270fe061_bed_145ced4f

Now plan calls.

Call 1: add books to bookshelf, also vase and figurines. Let&#x27;s add e.g., 8 books (type book), 1 vase, 2 figurines. Use placement_condition: &quot;Add 8 books on room_270fe061_bookshelf_0b575bfe (arranged vertically and horizontally across the shelves); Add 1 vase on room_270fe061_bookshelf_0b575bfe (top shelf); Add 2 figurines on room_270fe061_bookshelf_0b575bfe (middle shelves).&quot;

Call 2: add items to wall shelves. Items: on each shelf place maybe 3 books, 1 plant, 1 lamp. So total per shelf 5 items. Use both shelf ids.

Call 3: desk items.

Call 4: dresser items.

Call 5: nightstand items + pillows on bed + floor lamp + floor plant.

Pillow type: pillow.

Floor lamp: place on floor near bed.

We need to ensure we don&#x27;t exceed 10-12 types per call; each call currently under.

Proceed with calls.

                                <div class="thinking-content">We see failures: many books and vase failed to be placed on bookshelf. Likely due to capacity or overlapping. We need to retry with fewer items or adjust placement. We need at least 5 books per shelf level; we placed 3 books only. Let&#x27;s try again adding more books but ensure they fit.

We can add books individually maybe using &quot;Add 5 book on room_270fe061_bookshelf_0b575bfe&quot;. The tool may handle placement; earlier many failures maybe due to overlapping. Let&#x27;s try a new call focusing on adding additional books (maybe 5) and also a plant (allowed) on bookshelf.

Also we need to add items to wall shelves. Let&#x27;s proceed step by step.

First, add 5 books to bookshelf (maybe &quot;Add 5 book on room_270fe061_bookshelf_0b575bfe&quot;). Also add a small plant on top shelf.

We&#x27;ll call place_objects_in_room with those actions.

But need to respect restrictions: no rug, blanket, etc. The critic suggestions include items like mirror on wall, art, cabinet etc. Mirror we can add (wall-mounted). Floor lamps allowed. Plants allowed. No blanket. Avoid adding rug or blanket.

We also need to ensure each shelf has &gt;5 items. Currently bookshelf has: books (3 placed) + figurines (2) + earlier books (3? Actually we have book_3,5,7,4 = 4 books) plus earlier items maybe failed. So currently we have 4 books, 2 figurines = 6 items on bookshelf. Need &gt;5, satisfied.

Wall shelves: need to have items too. They currently empty. We need to add books, figurines, plant, vase, notebook maybe. At least 5 per shelf.

Also need items on desk: pen, notebook, lamp, phone, mug, maybe laptop? The earlier critic suggested laptop, but not required. We&#x27;ll add those.

Nightstands: need bedside lamp, book, phone maybe. Also need pillows on bed (allowed). Add 2 pillows.

Floor lamp(s): maybe only one near bed, not two.

Plants: at least some on floor.

Mirror on wall above dresser.

Wall art maybe (painting already placed; art maybe fine). But we already have paintings. Could add another piece? Might be okay.

Let&#x27;s proceed stage by stage.

Stage 1: Add desk items (pen, notebook, lamp, phone, mug). Use place_objects_in_room.

Stage 2: Add nightstand items (lamps, books, phones) and pillows on bed.

Stage 3: Add wall shelf items (books, figurine, plant, vase, notebook) for both shelf_1 and shelf_2.

Stage 4: Add floor lamp and floor plant, plus wall mirror.

Make sure each call stays under 12 types.

We&#x27;ll do call 1: desk items.

                                <div class="thinking-content">We see the critic again suggests rugs, blanket, etc. We must ignore rug and blanket. Also we already placed some books on bookshelf but need more to meet &gt;5 per shelf. It&#x27;s currently 4 books + 2 figurines + 1 plant? Actually plant failed earlier. We have 4 books (book_3,5,7,4) + 2 figurines = 6 items, good, but need maybe more variety, but okay.

Now need to add items to wall shelves (both). Also need to add nightstand items (lamp, book, phone) and pillows on bed. Also need mirror on wall (above dresser) and maybe additional wall art if not over limit. Also floor lamp, floor plant.

Let&#x27;s do a call for nightstand items and pillows. Add 2 pillows on bed; add lamp on each nightstand, book, phone.

We have nightstand IDs. We&#x27;ll place lamp on each nightstand: &quot;Add 1 lamp on room_270fe061_nightstand_56d58526&quot; etc. Also add book and phone.

Also add pillows on bed: &quot;Add 2 pillow on room_270fe061_bed_145ced4f&quot; (pillow is placed on bed, considered as object on bed, that is surface of bed? The bed is a big piece; we can place pillow on bed. According to location rules: pillow on bed? The bed is a furniture object; we can use object_id. So it&#x27;s okay.

Proceed.

                                <div class="thinking-content">We need to ensure all requirements: each shelf has &gt;5 objects.

Currently:

- bookshelf has: books 3 (earlier) + 2 figurines + 1 plant? The plant added failed, but we have 3 books (book_3,5,7) + 2 figurines + 1 book_4 = 4? Actually book_4 also. So total 5 (book3,5,7,4 = 4) + 2 figurines = 6. Good, &gt;5.

- wall shelves: shelf_1d7488fd has 2 books and 1 plant (plant2) but lamp failed. So now only 3 items, need &gt;5. We can add more books, maybe more figurines, mugs.

- shelf_293d2c09 has 3 books, lamp failed, plant failed. So 3 items.

We need to add more items to both wall shelves to reach &gt;5 each.

Also ensure each supporter like desk already has many items; nightstands have lamp, book, phone, later we may add more. Dresser currently has no items yet (mirror, vase, etc not placed because mirror placed on wall, not dresser). We need to place items on dresser (books, mug, etc) to satisfy supporter rule.

Also need to add alarm_clock on left nightstand (failed earlier). We&#x27;ll need to place these.

We must avoid exceeding 12 types per call. New types needed: mug, plant (already), lamp (already), book (already), figurine (already). New types: alarm_clock, maybe additional plant. Already have those.

We&#x27;ll plan a call to add missing items:

- Add 1 lamp on room_270fe061_shelf_1d7488fd (maybe fails before, but try again)
- Add 1 lamp on room_270fe061_shelf_293d2c09
- Add additional books to both shelves: e.g., add 2 books each.
- Add 1 mug on each wall shelf.
- Add 1 alarm_clock on left nightstand (room_270fe061_nightstand_56d58526) (previous failed)
- Add items on dresser: maybe 1 mirror on dresser? Mirror was placed on wall; we can add a small decorative vase, a book, a mug on dresser.

- Add 1 plant on floor already placed, okay.

Let&#x27;s craft placement_conditions with these actions.

Be mindful not to exceed 12 types: types used: book, lamp, mug, alarm_clock, vase, plant (already used). That&#x27;s 6 types.

Proceed.

                                <div class="thinking-content">We need to check if requirements satisfied:

- Each shelf &gt;5 objects: 
  - bookshelves (tall): has books 3 (book_3,5,7) + book_4 + book1_1 + figurines etc =&gt; count &gt;5.
  - wall shelf 1 (shelf_1d7488fd): has books2_1,2 plus bookshelf1_1,2 (two pairs of books) plus mug1 + plant2 =&gt; total: 2 (book2_1,2) + 2 (bookshelf1_1,2 each are pair? Actually each entry is pair of two books, but still counts as objects? The description says &quot;pair of paperback books&quot; it&#x27;s considered one object? Might be considered one object but it&#x27;s okay. Still &gt;5 items? We have maybe 4 objects (book2_1, book2_2, bookshelf1_1, bookshelf1_2, mug1, plant2) = 6 objects, good.

  - shelf_293d2c09: similar: book3_1,2,3 + bookshelf2_1,2 + mug2 = 6 objects.

So shelves satisfied.

- Supporter items: Dresser has vase, book, mug. Good.

- Nightstands have lamp, book, phone, alarmclock now (left nightstand has alarmclock placed; right nightstand has alarmclock2 previously). Good.

- Desk has pen (3), notebook (2), laptop, mug, lamp, phone. Good.

- Floor has plant4 (ferns), plus maybe more plants? We have plant4 only. Could add another plant but not required.

- No rugs, blankets etc.

- Mirror on wall placed, but also maybe need a mirror on dresser? Not required.

- Wall art present: painting_1, painting_2, wallart piece.

- Not missing bed, wardrobe, dresser, desk, chair, bookshelf, nightstands. Good.

- Ensure each shelf has &gt;5 objects, done.

Now we should verify any remaining failures: lamp placements on shelves failed earlier; we attempted but failed. The wall shelves still missing lamps (lamp1 and lamp2). Could try again to add lamps on shelves, maybe use different IDs or just try adding lamp again.

We also have a lamp on floor not yet placed. The next step suggests adding floor lamp.

We should add a floor lamp near bed, and maybe also another lamp if needed. Since we still have failures for lamps on shelves, we can attempt again.

Let&#x27;s place:

- Add 1 lamp on room_270fe061_shelf_1d7488fd (maybe use different model).
- Add 1 lamp on room_270fe061_shelf_293d2c09.
- Add 1 floor lamp on floor (maybe near bed).
- Maybe also add a small plant on floor if desired.

Make sure types &lt;=12: lamp, floor_lamp, plant (already have plant4). New types: floor_lamp (new). So two types.

Proceed.

- Each supporter (desk, dresser, nightstands) have small objects:

  - Desk: pen (2), pen (new), pen (metal), notebook (2), laptop, mug, lamp, phone. Yes.

  - Dresser: vase, bookdresser, mugdresser. Good.

  - Nightstands: left: lamp1, book1, phone1, alarmclock, maybe also pillow? Not needed.

    Right: lamp2, book2, phone2, alarmclock2. Good.

- Floor has plant4, floorlamp, maybe other floor plant? Plant on floor left, okay.

- No rugs/blanket, we have blankets? No blanket placed. Good.

- Mirrors: wall mirror placed; okay.

- Bed has pillows, good.

- Need to ensure total objects reasonable. Over 35-40 objects: we have many. Good.

Now need to ensure no remaining missing requirements: The only failures are lamp on wall shelves could not be placed, but it&#x27;s not required that a lamp be on shelves; we already have many items on shelves, so it&#x27;s okay.

We should finalize. Possibly add a small decorative object to fill shelf lamp missing? Not required.

Thus the scene is complete. Provide final answer describing the room layout and objects placed with styles.</div>
