Rich of daily furniture and objects.&quot;<br>- Contains the necessary furniture and setup for the specified function.<br>- Each objects is in **reasonable size**, neatly placed, objects of the same category are well aglined, relationships are reasonable (e.g., chairs face desks), sufficient space exists for walking, and **orientations must** be correct.<br>- [IMPORTANT] All necessary large and small items are present. Has rich details. <br>[IMPORTANT] Each shelf is full of objects (&gt;5) inside. <br>[IMPORTANT] Each supporter (e.g. table, desk, and shelf) has small objects on it. <br>[IMPORTANT] The room feels done.<br>[IMPORTANT] You can&#x27;t stop the scene generation before all necessary object placements have been done.</p><p>You must avoid:<br>- Unusual objects or strange placements make the room unrealistic.<br>- Missing key objects or contains mismatched furniture (e.g., no bed in a bedroom).<br>- Floating objects, crowded floor, **abnormal size**, objects with collision, incorrect **orientation**, or large items placed oddly (e.g., sofa not against the wall). Large empty space. Blocker in front of furniture.<br>- Room is sparse or empty, lacks decor or key elements.</p><p>(ix) Don&#x27;t try to replace all objects in room, <br>it would remove all objects you have placed in.</p><p>(x) Pay attention to the place_id of objects.</p><p>(xi) How to decide what objects to place?<br>- [IMPORTANT] From the user requirements here. You need to ensure all the requirements for object placements here are all satisfied.<br>- [IMPORTANT] From the failured placements each iterations. You need to retry once if the failure happens when placing objects.<br>You can try to place other smaller types of objects if placements failed due to limited space.<br>- [IMPORTANT] From the semantic critic info. You need to combine all the proposed actions in semantic info to place those urgent needed objects.<br>Special notes: never add rugs, mats, curtains, blanket, ceiling-hanging objects (already installed).</p><p>(xii) When to stop generating the scene?<br>[IMPORTANT] You need to keep track of the current object placement situation to decide.<br>[IMPORTANT] You can&#x27;t stop the scene generation before all necessary object placements have been done:<br>[IMPORTANT] 1. All necessary large and small items are present. Has rich details. <br>[IMPORTANT] 2. Each shelf is full of objects (&gt;5) inside. <br>[IMPORTANT] 3. Each supporter (e.g. table, desk, and shelf) has small objects on it. <br>If placements of small on top objects are failed, keep trying different kinds of objects.<br>[IMPORTANT] When you want to stop, please check every condition above and ensure all have been satisfied before you stop.<br>[IMPORTANT] You are encouraged to keep trying placing objects if they are reasonable.<br>[IMPORTANT] Don&#x27;t be afraid of failure of placements. Please keep trying instead of suddenly stopping.</p><p>Notes:</p><p>When placing objects, you need to specify where each object should be located. <br>The location can be one of three types:</p><p>(i) &quot;floor&quot; - for objects that sit on the ground/floor. This includes objects placed against walls, in corners, beside/next to other floor objects, or anywhere on the floor surface.</p><p>Examples: <br>- A table against the wall → use &quot;floor&quot; (the table sits on floor near the wall)<br>- A sofa in the corner → use &quot;floor&quot; (the sofa sits on floor in the corner)<br>- A chair next to / beside / left of / right of / in front of the table → use &quot;floor&quot; (the chair sits on floor near the table)</p><p>(ii) &quot;wall&quot; - ONLY for objects that are physically attached or mounted directly on the wall surface, and always attached above the floor, such as wall shelves, paintings, or wall-mounted TVs.</p><p>Examples:<br>- A picture on the wall → use &quot;wall&quot; (the picture is mounted on the wall and above the floor)<br>- A wall-mounted cabinet above the bed → use &quot;wall&quot; (the cabinet is attached to the wall and above the floor)</p><p>(iii) &quot;object_id&quot; or &quot;estimated_object_name&quot; - ONLY for objects that are placed onto/on top of another existing object. </p><p>Use &quot;object_id&quot; when you know the exact id of the existing object. Use &quot;estimated_object_name&quot; when you&#x27;re not certain of the exact object id or the object is about to be placed.</p><p>Examples:<br>- A lamp on a table → use the table&#x27;s object_id (the lamp goes on top of the table)<br>- A plate on the kitchen cabinet in front of the chair → use the cabinet&#x27;s object_id (the plate goes on top of the cabinet)</p><p>[IMPORTANT] The key distinction: if the spatial relationship is NOT &quot;on top of&quot; (e.g., beside, next to, in front of), you cannot use object_id or estimated_object_name.

We need to call generate_room_layout with description: medium-sized bedroom, single room.

After layout, we need to check layout info via get_current_layout maybe, but we can place objects using place_objects_in_room.

We need to specify placement_conditions with details: list objects, types, locations, relationships.

We must ensure style consistency - style likely from layout generation; may need to retrieve layout info. Let&#x27;s call generate_room_layout.</div>

The room should include 7 floor-placed furniture and background objects: A low\u2011profile platform bed placed on floor; 2 A sleek wooden nightstands placed on floor; A tall minimal dresser placed on floor; A compact white desk placed on floor; An ergonomic mesh chair placed on floor; A narrow wall bookshelf placed on floor; A tall metal floor lamp placed on floor. Wall decorations consist of 5 items: Abstract canvas art mounted on wall; A rectangular frameless mirror mounted on wall; Floating wooden wall shelf mounted on wall; 2 A small photo frames mounted on wall; A minimalist wall clock mounted on wall. Furniture surfaces should be decorated with 10 functional and decorative objects: A small potted succulent placed on desk; A slim laptop computer placed on desk; A leather\u2011bound notebook placed on desk; A set of ballpoint pens placed on desk; 6 A hardcover design books placed on bookshelf; 2 A ceramic vases placed on nightstand; A decorative glass bowl placed on dresser; A compact desktop speaker placed on desk; A bedside smartphone charger placed on nightstand; A small jewelry tray placed on dresser. Each furniture surface such as tables, desks, shelves, and cabinets should have at least 2 or more decorative or functional objects placed on top to create a lived-in, realistic environment. Important constraints: Do not add rugs, mats, carpets, curtains, blankets, ceiling-hanging objects, or ceiling objects to the scene as these are either already installed or restricted. The complete scene must contain a minimum of 22 objects total following the placement proposals described above to achieve a complete, diverse, and realistic room environment.Must ensure that: i. The layout (position, rotation, and size) is believable, and common daily objects make the room feel lived-in. Rich of daily furniture and objects.ii. Contains the necessary furniture and setup for the specified function.iii. Each objects is in **reasonable size**, neatly placed, objects of the same category are well aglined, relationships are reasonable (e.g., chairs face desks), sufficient space exists for walking, and **orientations must** be correct. iv. All necessary large and small items are present. Has rich details. Each shelf is full of objects (&gt;5) inside. Each supporter (e.g. table, desk, and shelf) has small objects on it. The room feels done.Must avoid that: i. Unusual objects or strange placements make the room unrealistic.ii. Missing key objects or contains mismatched furniture (e.g., no bed in a bedroom).iii. Floating objects, crowded floor, **abnormal size**, objects with collision, incorrect **orientation**, or large items placed oddly (e.g., sofa not against the wall). Large empty space. Blocker in front of furniture.iv. Room is sparse or empty, lacks decor or key elements.&quot;<br>}</p></div>

                                <div class="thinking-content">We have layout generated, includes scene recommendations. Now need to place objects.

We must follow multiple calls stage-wise, not exceed 35-40 objects per call and not &gt;10-12 types per call.

Total objects recommended: floor furniture: bed, 2 nightstands, dresser, desk, chair, bookshelf, floor lamp = 7 floor furniture. Wall decorations: abstract canvas, mirror, floating shelf, 2 photo frames, wall clock = 5 items. Surface objects: succulents, laptop, notebook, pens on desk; design books on bookshelf (6); ceramic vases on nightstand (2); glass bowl on dresser; desktop speaker on desk; smartphone charger on nightstand; jewelry tray on dresser. That&#x27;s 10 surface objects. Total recommended objects: 7+5+10 =22. Good.

We need to place objects in stages. First stage: large floor furniture (bed, nightstands, dresser, desk, chair, bookshelf, floor lamp). That&#x27;s 7 types, 7 objects (though 2 nightstands distinct but same type). That&#x27;s within limit.

Need to specify location: floor, with relations e.g., bed centered against wall, nightstands on either side, dresser against wall, desk near window maybe, chair at desk, bookshelf against wall, floor lamp near bedside.

We need object IDs we don&#x27;t have yet; we can refer to &quot;estimated_object_name&quot; maybe not.

When placing, we need to include object type, quantity, location, relationships, style.

We&#x27;ll use place_objects_in_room with placement_conditions describing all these.

Let&#x27;s craft: &quot;Place 1 platform bed (modern minimalist, low-profile, wooden frame) on floor, centered against the longest wall; Place 2 nightstands (sleek wooden, matte finish) on floor, one on each side of the bed, near the bed; Place 1 tall minimal dresser (white, modern) on floor, against the wall opposite the bed; Place 1 compact white desk on floor, near the window, against the wall; Place 1 ergonomic mesh chair on floor, positioned at the desk, facing the desk; Place 1 narrow wall bookshelf (metal frame, wood shelves) on floor, placed against the wall near the desk; Place 1 tall metal floor lamp on floor, next to the right nightstand.&quot;

That&#x27;s 7 types, 7 objects, okay.

We&#x27;ll need room_id: from layout, room id is &quot;room_db644343&quot;. Use that.

We also have a suggestion to rotate dresser; perhaps we need to move it.

But we can also just add objects; not required to rotate but better.

We&#x27;ll first try to place the floor lamp correctly. Use move_one_object? Actually lamp not placed yet. So we need to place it via place_objects_in_room with condition referencing placement. It&#x27;s a floor lamp, we can place near the left nightstand perhaps.

We need to also add many surface objects: books on bookshelf, vase, plant, laptop, pens, notebooks on desk, lamps on nightstands, books/phones, plant on floor, vase on floor, etc.

We should do this in stages, not exceeding limits.

First stage: place floor lamp.

Second stage: add surface objects to bookshelf (books, vase, plant) and desk items (laptop, pens, notebooks) and nightstand items (lamps, books, phone). Also add floor plant and floor vase.

We must keep object count per call under 35-40, types under 10-12. We&#x27;ll do all at once maybe within limits (we have many items but maybe around 20 objects, types: book, vase, plant, laptop, pen, notebook, lamp, phone, maybe decorative glass bowl etc. That&#x27;s about 9 types. Should be okay.

We need to reference object IDs for placing on top. We have IDs from earlier placement: bed_..., nightstand_4c65eb67, nightstand_69ab312d, dresser_..., desk_..., chair_..., bookshelf_...

We also have lamp not placed; we might need a new lamp id? We can just place floor lamp as new object.

We&#x27;ll call place_objects_in_room again with all additions.

We need to specify placements like &quot;Place 1 floor lamp (tall metal) on floor, next to the left nightstand&quot; - we need location. Provide location floor.

Let&#x27;s do that.

Then add others: &quot;Place 8 books on bookshelf (ID: room_db644343_bookshelf_37047613)&quot; etc.

We need to ensure correct phrasing: &quot;Place X [object_type] on [location]&quot; The tool expects a description, not strict syntax, but we need to specify.

We can combine all.

Let&#x27;s call place_objects_in_room with comprehensive list.

                                <div class="thinking-content">We still have some failures: floor lamp (tall) not placed, plant2, vase2, book_7, extra pens, notebooks. We need to handle those.

Goal: complete scene with all required items. We need to place floor lamp, plus additional small items suggested (more books on bookshelf, more notebooks, pens, plant, vase). Also address suggestions: add rug (though earlier note says no rugs? Actually note said &quot;Special notes: never add rugs, mats, curtains, blanket, ceiling-hanging objects (already installed).&quot; So we must not add rug. So we should ignore rug suggestion. Also mirror on wall: wall item allowed, we can add if not prohibited. Mirror seems okay (not ceiling). So we can add.

We need to place floor lamp on floor near something, perhaps near the foot of the bed or near dresser. Use place_objects_in_room.

We also need to add missing items: additional books (5), vase, plant for bookshelf, 2 notebooks, 3 pens, maybe additional books on nightstand already placed but they exist.

Also need to add mirror on wall.

Also need to add plant on floor near dresser.

Also need to fix missing items: a floor lamp (tall) maybe lamp0.

We have failures for plant2, vase2, book_7; we can try to place them again with explicit placements.

We can combine all needed objects in one call, but must keep under 35 objects and 10-12 types. Let&#x27;s count types: floor lamp, vase, plant, books, notebooks, pens, mirror. That&#x27;s 7 types, okay. Number of objects: floor lamp (1), vase2 (1), plant2 (1), book_7 (1), additional 5 books maybe but we already placed 7; they want 5 more - but we can add 5 additional books. That plus 2 notebooks, 3 pens. Total new objects ~13. Within limit.

Let&#x27;s place:

- floor lamp (tall brushed steel) on floor near foot of bed (centered)
- vase2 (glass) on floor near dresser maybe on top of dresser? Actually vase is small; could place on floor near dresser as per earlier suggestion; we can place on floor near dresser.
- plant2 on floor near bookshelf (corner)
- book_7 on bookshelf (same location)
- additional 5 books on bookshelf (IDs new)
- 2 notebooks on desk
- 3 pens on desk
- mirror on wall above dresser (wall)
- maybe also add a small decorative bowl on dresser (optional but not required). Could add.

Let&#x27;s place them.

                                <div class="thinking-content">We have many failed placements: books_1-5, notebooks, pens, etc. Also floor lamp positioning suggestion to move closer to desk or bed. Mirror reposition near dresser.

We need to place missing objects and possibly reposition lamp and mirror.

We can use move_one_object_with_condition for lamp and mirror. Also need to place the failed objects again.

We can try to place the books and other items with proper location specification, maybe smaller groups to avoid failures.

Let&#x27;s attempt to place books_1-5 onto bookshelf again with explicit location &quot;on room_db644343_bookshelf_37047613, on middle shelves&quot;. Provide separate calls maybe.

Because we can place up to 10-12 types per call, and total objects maybe 5 books + 2 notebooks + 2 pens etc. That&#x27;s okay.

We also need to place notebooks and pens on desk (they failed earlier). Provide explicit location &quot;on room_db644343_desk_32f0b6e1, near laptop&quot;. Provide multiple objects.

Also move lamp: move close to desk.

Move mirror near dresser: wall location near dresser.

Let&#x27;s first move lamp with move_one_object_with_condition. Need to specify &quot;Move floor lamp (object_id: room_db644343_lamp_f7b7aaf9) to floor, near the desk, aligned with the desk&quot;. According to format: &quot;Move floor lamp (object_id: ...) to floor, [spatial relationships]&quot;. The relationships could be &quot;near desk&quot;. We&#x27;ll phrase: &quot;Move floor lamp (object_id: room_db644343_lamp_f7b7aaf9) to floor, near the desk&quot;. That should be fine.

Similarly move mirror: &quot;Move wall mirror (object_id: room_db644343_mirror_0aac8eb1) to wall, above the dresser&quot;. Format: &quot;Move wall mirror (object_id: ...) to wall, above the dresser&quot;. That fits.

Now place books and other items.

We need to reference book ids for new placements; they&#x27;re new IDs, we can just call place_objects_in_room with &quot;Add 5 books on room_db644343_bookshelf_37047613&quot;. The system will generate IDs.

Let&#x27;s make a call to place_objects_in_room combining: 5 books, 2 notebooks, 3 pens on desk, plus maybe 2 pens on bookshelf as extra decorative.

We also need to place missing notebook to bookshelf maybe, but not necessary.

We&#x27;ll try.

                                <div class="thinking-content">Now we need to address remaining missing items and suggestions: many add actions still pending. We have still missing books, vases, plants, pens on bookshelf, laptop etc already placed earlier; we have laptop placed; we have some pens placed (pen_3) but others failed. We still need notebooks on desk (failed), pens on desk (2 missing), cup (not placed), etc.

We also have suggestion to move bed away from door and reorient lamp. Could adjust but maybe not crucial; but to satisfy critic, we should move bed and lamp orientation.

First, move bed: need to know door location but we can just move bed &quot;away from the door&quot;. Use move_one_object_with_condition: &quot;Move platform bed (object_id: room_db644343_bed_635fe040) to floor, center of room&quot;. That should place away from door. Provide location floor.

Second, reorient lamp: maybe rotate or reposition to face desk. Already moved near desk; we can &quot;move floor lamp (object_id: ...) to floor, near the desk, facing the desk&quot;. Use condition with spatial relationship maybe &quot;near the desk, facing the desk&quot;. Might be acceptable.

Now we need to place missing items. Let&#x27;s compile a placement_conditions call that adds:

- 5 books on bookshelf
- 1 vase on bookshelf
- 1 plant on bookshelf
- 2 pens on bookshelf
- 1 laptop already placed (maybe duplicate but okay)
- 1 notebook on desk
- 2 pens on desk (additional)
- 1 cup on desk
- 1 book on nightstand_4c65eb67 (already have lamp and book, but add another)
- 1 phone on nightstand_4c65eb67 (already there)
- 1 lamp on nightstand_4c65eb67 (already there)
- similarly for nightstand_69ab312d add extra book+phone+lamp maybe already have.
- Add vase on dresser, plant on dresser, mirror on dresser (these are new)
- Add floor plant, floor vase, floor book (optional) but ensure no rugs.

We must not exceed 10-12 types. Current types: book, vase, plant, pen, notebook, cup, lamp (already), mirror, maybe coffee mug.

We are okay.

Let&#x27;s place these in a single call but ensure quantity not too high (maybe 20 objects okay). Let&#x27;s combine.

                                <div class="thinking-content">Now we need to address failures still: many bookshelf items, desk items, nightstand items, dresser plant missing, also suggestions about bed placement (center causing path block), dresser orientation.

We must move bed to side against wall. Also dresser rotation.

Let&#x27;s move bed again: &quot;Move platform bed (object_id: room_db644343_bed_635fe040) to floor, against the left wall&quot;. Provide location &quot;floor&quot; near left wall maybe.

Also move dresser: &quot;Move dresser (object_id: room_db644343_dresser_17a8a42d) to floor, against the wall, rotate to short side facing room&quot;. The tool expects location floor and maybe spatial relationship only. We&#x27;ll do &quot;to floor, against the wall&quot;. Rotation may be automatic.

Now need to place missing bookshelf items: we can attempt to add plural. Provide simple call: add 5 books, 2 vases, 2 plants, 3 books (maybe duplicates) but some failures earlier due to overload. Let&#x27;s try adding 4 books and 1 vase and 1 plant.

Also need to place desk items: keyboard, mouse, power strip, notebook, pens, can try add.

Nightstand items: more books, clock, phone charger etc.

Dresser plant missing: add plant to dresser.

We must keep each call under 35 objects and 10-12 types.

We can make one call with many additions but within types limit. Types now: book, vase, plant, keyboard, mouse, power strip, notebook, pen, clock, phone charger. That&#x27;s 10 types.

Let&#x27;s attempt.

                                <div class="thinking-content">We have many failures still, and bed positioning still not ideal. The tool seems to have difficulty placing many objects on bookshelf and desk. Perhaps due to space constraints. Could simplify by not filling all but ensure each supporter has &gt;2 objects. Already many.

We need to satisfy the requirement: each shelf &gt;5 objects. Currently bookshelf has many books but some failed placements; still there are many books placed earlier (book_1-6, book_8, bookshelfb..., plus vase1 etc). Count: existing placed on bookshelf: book_1-6, book_8 (7), vase1, plant1, bookshelfb..._5, bookshelfvase, vase (new). That&#x27;s &gt;5, okay.

Desk has laptop, pen, speaker, pen_3, notebook, deskpen (two sets), cup, notebook_2. That&#x27;s many.

Nightstands have lamps, books, chargers.

Dresser has vase, mirror, dresservase.

We still have failed placements like keyboard, mouse, powerstrip etc, but not mandatory.

The main remaining suggestions: move bed to left wall, move dresser orientation. Let&#x27;s move bed to left wall (against wall). Use move_one_object condition: &quot;Move platform bed (object_id: room_db644343_bed_635fe040) to floor, against the left wall&quot;. Provide location floor.

Also rotate dresser: maybe &quot;Move dresser (object_id: room_db644343_dresser_17a8a42d) to floor, against the wall&quot;. Might also need rotate but tool may handle.

Let&#x27;s apply moves.

But the requirement is each supporter has at least 2 small objects; dresser currently empty after removal, we must add again.

We also still have many failures for bookshelf items and desk items. However we have many already placed, maybe enough. But to satisfy &quot;Each shelf is full of objects (&gt;5) inside&quot;: bookshelf currently has many books (book_1-6, book_8, book_fa294008, bookshelfbook_5, vase, vase1, plant1). That&#x27;s &gt;5; even if some failed, still many present.

Desk has laptop, pen, speaker, pen_3, notebook, deskpen, cup, notebook_2, charger (on nightstand). That&#x27;s enough.

Nightstands have lamps, books, smartphone, charger.

Dresser empty; need to place at least 2 small objects: maybe vase and mirror again plus maybe a jewelry tray.

We also need to move mirror to above dresser per suggestion. That would also place mirror correctly.

Let&#x27;s place objects: add a vase and a small mirror on dresser, and move wall mirror above dresser. We already have mirror on wall but need to reposition; we can move it now.

First move mirror: &quot;Move wall mirror (object_id: room_db644343_mirror_0aac8eb1) to wall, above the dresser&quot;. Use move_one_object.

Also add keyboard, mouse, pen holder, etc. Many of these have failed previously. We&#x27;ll try to add a batch focusing on objects that previously failed: keyboard, mouse, pen holder, desk accessories, also dresser items.

Let&#x27;s place:

- 1 vase on dresser (object to be placed on dresser)
- 1 small decorative mirror on dresser (maybe mirror already placed above dresser, but we can also have a small mirror on dresser surface).
- 1 jewelry box on dresser.

- 1 keyboard on desk
- 1 mouse on desk
- 1 pen holder on desk
- Additionally, maybe a small desk lamp (but floor lamp exists)

We must reference object IDs: dresser_17a8a42d, desk_32f0b6e1.

Let&#x27;s call place_objects_in_room.

Need to ensure each shelf has &gt;5 objects: bookshelf has many books and vases, plants, etc. Count: books (book_1-6, book_8, book_fa294008, bookshelfbook_5) = 9, plus vase1, vase_f05d, vase (new), plants (plant1, etc). So &gt;5.

Desk has laptop, pen, pen_3, speaker, notebook, cup, deskpen, mouse, maybe some pens. That&#x27;s enough.

Nightstands have lamp1, lamp2, book, smartphone, charger, nightstandbook. Good.

Dresser now empty because items removed; we haven&#x27;t added back. We need at least 2 objects on dresser. Our recent attempt to add vase, mirror, box failed. Need to place something on dresser.

Maybe add a decorative tray and a piece of jewelry. Try to add simpler objects: &quot;Add 1 decorative tray on room_db644343_dresser_17a8a42d; Add 1 small potted plant on room_db644343_dresser_17a8a42d.&quot;

We may also try to add a picture frame on wall but not needed.

Let&#x27;s place these.

Need to place at least two objects on dresser. The previous attempts failed. Maybe we can place a simple decorative box and a small lamp? But lamp already used on nightstand. Could place a &quot;tray&quot; again but maybe fails due to space. Could place a &quot;photo frame&quot; on dresser wall? The dresser surface maybe top, but we can place on object ID.

Maybe we can add &quot;small decorative bowl&quot; on dresser. Let&#x27;s try adding a &quot;decorative bowl&quot; and a &quot;small succulents&quot; (maybe different). Use place_objects_in_room.
